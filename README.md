# Marlin-2.0-Sensorless-Homing

My 3D printer is a modified ANET A8 with:

* SKR PRO v1.1 motherboard
* 4x TMC2209 stepper motor drivers (X, Y, Z1, Z2)
* Standard Titan Extruder
* V6 all-metal hotend

I have started this repository to help me enable sensorless homing for the X, Y, and Z axis. 

Progress:

* X axis sensorless homing is working 
* Y axis sensorless homing is working

Bugs: 

* Z axis sensorless probing not working
